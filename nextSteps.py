just take profit over 2 years results in losses
take profit and stop loss sma crossover results in severe losses 100000 reduced to 5000



take profit and stop loss should go in together, need to use bracket orders
then maybe include VWMA to see improvement
trailing stop loss without taking profit is also a good idea, to catch the peaks and variable profitablity

analyze every day or every weeks trades 
as backtesting is not real testing, see if we can count on params computed using last 2 months, 1 months data
and use it for one day/one week in reality


find signals and place multiple buy orders wait for their take profit close.



70 percent in 4 months for BTC data in 2019.
backtest for entire  2 year BTC data to see results. //simple take profit obviously returns in losses



done // test with wazirx data as well.



done // get 30 min data(last 1 year), exhaustive test using sma crossover to identify the peak profit params //done
done //81 percent per year on wazir USDT INR market so far.

360 percent is the goal. position sizing trying to catch more signals, long, short at the same time, along with leverage.(vwap, volume, RSI divergence is key)
